Subject: [PATCH 01/12] PENDING: arm64: dts: qcom: qcs9100: Add support for the
 QCS9100 Ride and Ride Rev3 boards

Add device tree support for the QCS9100 Ride and Ride Rev3 boards. The
QCS9100 is a variant of the SA8775p, and they are fully compatible with
each other. The QCS9100 Ride/Ride Rev3 board is essentially the same as
the SA8775p Ride/Ride Rev3 board, with the QCS9100 SoC mounted instead
of the SA8775p.

This is a port of the upstream Linux patch to U-Boot.
